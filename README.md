# VAYU-M-Visualization-Analysis-of-Yearly-Understanding---Migration-
ML Model for Visualization &amp; Analysis of Yearly Understanding - Migration
# Wildlife Migration Analysis Using Machine Learning (India)

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a machine learning–based analysis of **CMS-listed migratory species in India**, combining **classification models**, **exploratory data analysis**, and **geospatial visualization** to identify migration hotspots and stopover regions.

## 📊 Dataset

- Over **12,000 occurrence records**
- Species classified based on **taxonomic and spatial features**

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
